👋 Hi, I’m @NidiaLopez. I'm Mexican, currently living in Iceland. 
👀 I’m interested in data science applications. 
🌱 I’m currently in the first year of my Ph.D. degree at Reykjavik University. My research is mainly focused on investigating the dynamics of undergradutate students' social networks.
💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Learning analytics and data science projects focused on Education improvement.

Random things about me: I love dancing, traveling, and tacos.
